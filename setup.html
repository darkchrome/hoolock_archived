        <h2>How to Set Up Coinbase Wallet</h2>
<div class="step-break">
        <h4>To receive or purchase NFTs, you will need a digital wallet. These steps cover the absolute minimum you
            need to know to set it up. </h4>

        <h4>If this is your first time setting up a wallet, we recommend using Coinbase Wallet. It is a simple browser
            plug-in, so it's easy to get started fast. Plus Coinbase has excellent educational resources and support
            in case you ever need it.</h4>

    <div class="step-break">
        <h3>Step 1</h3>


            <h4>Visit this <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/browser-extension/coinbase-wallet-extension">link</a>
                and follow the instructions for downloading and installing Coinbase Wallet. You will need to use the
                Chrome browser.</h4>

        </div>
            <div class="step-break">
            <h3>Step 2</h3>


            <h4>Once you have a wallet set up, you will see a screen that looks similar to the one below. Click around
                to familiarize yourself with it. The 'down arrow' button shows you your wallet address, which you can
                share with people similar to how you would share your email address. Since this is your first time setting
                up a wallet, you will see that your balance is $0 and you initially have no NFTs.</h4>

            <h3>Important considerations:</h3>
            <h4> Most of us are used to transactions that operate through a central provider (eg, Visa or Mastercard).
                Because your NFT-related transactions take place on a decentralized blockchain, there are a few
                important things to keep in mind:
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Since you never provided your name or email address, your identity is anonymous when you
                    exchange NFTs, including Coinbase. If you lose/forget your password or secret recovery
                    phrase, nobody can access your account - it's effectively lost. So write them down and keep them
                    in a safe place!<p></p>
                </li>

                <li>The identity of the person you are exchanging NFTs with is usually also anonymous.  On a decentralized
                    blockchain, transactions are not reversible once they are made.  So be careful when you make transactions.
                    Read the messages in the pop-up windows that appear.  If you're not sure about what they are telling you,
                    cancel/reject the transaction until you know what they mean.<p></p>

                </li>

                <li>Your private key is stored in your wallet and effectively represents 'ownership' of your
                    wallet. This key can be found in your wallet, but Coinbase intentionally makes it a little hard
                    to find because if you accidentally share it, someone else can take everything in your wallet.
                    Do not share your private key with anyone!
                </li>
            </ul>
                </h4>
        </div>
